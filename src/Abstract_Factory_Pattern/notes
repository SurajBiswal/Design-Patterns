ðŸ“Œ Flow of Abstract Factory Pattern
Step 1: Define Interfaces

Define an interface for each product type (e.g., Shape, Color).

This ensures multiple concrete classes can implement them.

Step 2: Implement Concrete Classes

Create different implementations for each product (e.g., Circle, Square, Red, Blue).

Each concrete class provides its specific implementation.

Step 3: Create Abstract Factory

Define an abstract factory class (AbstractFactory) that declares methods for creating different product types.

Step 4: Implement Concrete Factories

Implement specific factory classes (ShapeFactory, ColorFactory) that extend the abstract factory and create related objects.

Step 5: Create Factory Producer

Implement a FactoryProducer class that returns the appropriate factory based on the userâ€™s request.

Step 6: Client Code

The client (main program) calls the FactoryProducer, retrieves the correct factory, and requests object creation.

The client does not need to know which concrete class is being instantiated.

Client (Main Class)
    â†“
FactoryProducer (Decides which factory to return)
    â†“
AbstractFactory (Defines methods for creating objects)
    â”œâ”€â”€ ShapeFactory (Creates Shape objects)
    â”‚      â”œâ”€â”€ Circle (Implements Shape)
    â”‚      â”œâ”€â”€ Square (Implements Shape)
    â”‚
    â”œâ”€â”€ ColorFactory (Creates Color objects)
           â”œâ”€â”€ Red (Implements Color)
           â”œâ”€â”€ Blue (Implements Color)


ðŸ“Œ Flow in Java Code Execution
ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Client calls FactoryProducer.getFactory("SHAPE").
ðŸ”¹ Step 2: FactoryProducer returns ShapeFactory.
ðŸ”¹ Step 3: Client calls shapeFactory.getShape("CIRCLE").
ðŸ”¹ Step 4: ShapeFactory returns a new Circle object.
ðŸ”¹ Step 5: Client calls circle.draw(), and "Drawing a Circle" is printed.

Similarly, if the client calls FactoryProducer.getFactory("COLOR"), the ColorFactory is returned, and colors are created.

ðŸ”¥ Key Takeaways
âœ… The client is decoupled from object creation.
âœ… Factories ensure objects of the same family are created together.
âœ… Easy to extend by adding new factories without modifying client code.
